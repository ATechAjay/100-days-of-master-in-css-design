📌 You can use Clippy websites to clip your content.

[bennettfeely.com/clippy/](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/)

📌 One thing keeps in mind during building this design, is that we have to add the exact same number of clip path values in each keyframe point.

📌 or, we have to add the "same number" of points in each "%" of keyframes.

📌 Otherwise your animation does not work. [pic.twitter.com/pO60LbDUvb](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1486946085033906176/photo/1)

→ You have to clip your content at 0% and 100% similar to this image.

📌 Here you can see in this picture there are 16 points, 

that's why you have to take 16 points in each clip-path.

Then,

📌 at 50% you have to clip your content like this image. 

see, there are also 16 points.👇 [pic.twitter.com/BwQNCWVp3m](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1486946091363090436/photo/1)
