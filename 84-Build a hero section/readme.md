💚 This can be your small project.

👉 I am explaining each and everything of this design.

👉 Today we are going to build the main part of this design which is the "text" and "image" of the hero section.

⛔ This design is can take some days so stay tuned.

👉 See the layout of this design. [pic.twitter.com/2krxmyalmm](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1490994140490137603/photo/1)

1️⃣ First of all, we have to write our HTML code for the desired layout.

👉 There are 2 div's inside the "hero-container" one for the text and another one for the image of the hero section. [pic.twitter.com/s9rYsFjEWW](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1490994147469447169/photo/1)

👉 When we open the "hero-text-box" of the hero section, then inside that container there are many elements.

👇Including

- Heading
- text content
- buttons(links) [pic.twitter.com/uXvHc9WamL](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1490994154243235841/photo/1)

👉 And, When we open the container of hero image then there is our hero image. [pic.twitter.com/d1IKUP7kDN](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1490994160249499651/photo/1)

👉 I do not use PX values for this layout.

👉 We are going to use REM instead of PX

👉 That's why I am setting font size to 62.5% in the root element.

👉 The text box and image box are aligned using CSS Grid.

👉 So, we have to define two columns for the hero text and hero image with equal size.

⛔ All colors are temporary, we will change them. [pic.twitter.com/3OLmqvYvk7](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1490994941837070337/photo/1)

![3_1490994477263368192](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLETk9NaMAA5pi3.png)

👉 max-width: I have set the maximum width of the container will be 1300px or 130rem.

👉 And for centering your container to the viewport, I am going to use margin property.

- margin: 0 auto;

- margin from top and bottom will be 0

- and margin from left and right will be auto.

- Now your container will be center.

👉 For 100% occupying the image in its container, we have to set width to 100%!

👉 Now your image and text content will be spreading equally. [pic.twitter.com/zKLgl5FmxD](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1490994953648218117/photo/1)
