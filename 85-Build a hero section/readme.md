Let me explain!🧵👇 [pic.twitter.com/GO1Qvyel8J](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1491311105247162368/video/1)

📌 I have changed the file format of the image of the hero section into SVG Because it helps when we implement our website into dark mode.

📌 Today's we are going to work on the text content of the HERO section.

⛔ There is a problem when we design our secondary button which is "About me"

📌Now we are adding some space between the text content and image of the HERO section.

⛔ Remember this is a grid container, so we can easily set the "gap" property for the spacing between the text content and image of the HERO section. [pic.twitter.com/rFJAzGKWfZ](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1491311153867522049/photo/1)

📌 And for the spacing from top and bottom, we are going to use the padding property in the container of the HERO content. [pic.twitter.com/q0TfDZ0Fhr](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1491311160096083969/photo/1)
