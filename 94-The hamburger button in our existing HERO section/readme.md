⛔ NOTE: All designs are not fixed, they can be changed in future threads!

⛔ We are not going to implement the JS part for now at least in the CSS series!

📌 In this thread, we are going to add a hamburger button at the previous breakpoint which is 53rem = 848px!

📌 In our HERO section, we are going to use our hamburger button which we have already learned in our CSS series.

📌 This is the HTML code for the hamburger button.

→ And you can also design this button as given in the above tweets.

→Initially, we have set the display to none in the hamburger button of the HERO section.

⛔ Check the CSS code from line number 30! [pic.twitter.com/lSuHDuDVUx](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1494575161193811969/photo/1)

→Then, we have set the display to none of the navigation links when the width of the screen is less than 53rem. [pic.twitter.com/uplkhBiF4f](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1494575171671261190/photo/1)
