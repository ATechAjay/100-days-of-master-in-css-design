💚 There are many types of pseudo-elements but in this thread, we are going to discuss only two of them.

📌 ::before
📌 ::after

pseudo-elements

👀 Suppose, you want to add some content on your web page, probably you add some HTML elements then style them using CSS.

❓ right?

😎 But if you do not want to add any HTML elements for that content, that you need to add or insert in your page.

😎 Then you can achieve this using "before" and "after" pseudo-elements.

🎉 SOME KEY POINTS ABOUT BEFORE AND AFTER PSEUDO-ELEMENTS.

⇉ Any pseudo-elements are inline elements.

⇉ pseudo-elements do not exist in HTML documents.

⇉ But you can find it in your browser dev tools.

⇉ You can not select "before" and "after" pseudo-elements with your mouse(try it once ).

⇉ You can use (: :) for the pseudo-elements(Recommended in CSS3).

⇉ You have to define the "content" property inside the declaration block.

(more on "content" property  in the next🧵)

1️⃣ (: : before) pseudo elements

⇉ "before" pseudo-element is the "first" child of the selected element. [pic.twitter.com/QGWb4YTlA0](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1486631416322400262/photo/1)

⇉ Or, you can also think of some content placed "before" the content of the selected element.

⇉ But after using the "position" property it does not matter to use either "before" or "after" pseudo-elements.

2️⃣ (: : after) pseudo-elements

⇉ "after" pseudo-element is the "last"  child of the selected element.

⇉ Or, you can also think of some content placed "after" the content of the selected element. [pic.twitter.com/3LBt6sRc0A](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1486631425327579140/photo/1)
