💚 Day 9️⃣2️⃣ / 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ Master in CSS Design series!

🤔 Do you know?

→ What are rem and em units?

→ What are the differences b/w the rem and em units?

→ What's wrong with em unit?

→ Why did I love to use rem units?

⛔ So, This🧵 is for you!

Let me explain!🧵👇 [pic.twitter.com/IvJiUzMGcP](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1493880333107818498/photo/1)

⛔  First of all, we have to know, that only 2 choices we have for using units with CSS properties.

1️⃣ Absolute units (px, cm, mm, etc)

2️⃣ Relative units (rem, em, %, etc)

1️⃣ Absolute units

→ Absolute units are fixed units.

→ It is not used for responsive design.

→ At the end, all relative units are converted into PX units(Absolute units).

2️⃣ Relative units

→ But, if we think about responsiveness then we have to use relative units like rem, em, %, etc.

→ It helps in responsive design because its dynamic not fixed like pixels values.

→ That's why many developers love to use relative units.

📌 EM units

→ The EM units allow us to set the font size of an element relative to the font size of its parent element.

→ Or, it changed the size of the child element relative to its parent element. [pic.twitter.com/cSokYKZIPf](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1493880348257632257/photo/1)

⛔ Codepen link on EM unit:

→ But, when we used the EM unit with other properties within the child element, 

then it's changed relative to the font size of the child element itself. [pic.twitter.com/d2yyEoolm6](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1493880357602488322/photo/1)

📌 Disadvantage of EM unit

→ This is the problem with EM units!

→ It's compounded with the previous values!

10px
20px 
40px
80px
160px [pic.twitter.com/LgO5FFYH1D](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1493880367505305600/photo/1)

📌 REM unit

→ REM unit means ROOT EM.

→ That means it changed the size relative to the root element.

→ <HTML> is the root element of the web page.

→ We have to define the font size in the root element.

→ If we do not define the font size in the root element, then the default font size is 16px.

→ In other words, only the font size of the root element will be considered, without related to the parent elements like the EM unit.

💚 In short:

→ EM unit is relative to its parent element!

→ REM unit is relative to the ROOT element that is <HTML>!
