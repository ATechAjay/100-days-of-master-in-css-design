üìå Do you know??

‚Üí There are 2 types of strategies used during building a website!

1Ô∏è‚É£ Desktop-first (Desktop ‚Üí Mobile)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile-first (Mobile ‚Üí Desktop )

‚Üí A desktop-first strategy is most popular used during building a website.

‚Üí First of all, we are designed our website for the desktop, then we try to be compatible with smartphones or small screens.

‚Üí And exactly vice-versa, for the mobile-first strategy.

‚Üí Suppose there are 2 breakpoints on our website.

- at 600px
- And, at 1300px

‚Üí So in other words we have to move from 1300px to 600px or less.

‚Üí Because of desktop-first strategy. [pic.twitter.com/NmCj3LtgWn](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1492395352712167426/photo/1)

![3_1492386231359262727](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLYFXtPaUAcBnsC.png)

‚Üí Now, we want to add some style when the width of the screen is between 0 to 600px.

‚Üí So, we have to use the "max-width" property because we move from the 1300px or maximum screen size to small screen size.

üìå Or,
- Desktop-first ‚Üí max-width
- Mobile-first ‚Üí min-width [pic.twitter.com/xrzjRAG3eR](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1492395358718431236/photo/1)

![3_1492386257066164224](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLYFZNAagAAk28c.png)

‚Üí Also, if we want to add some styles when the width of the screen is between 1300px to 0.

‚Üí Then, we have to use also "max-width" property, similar to this image. [pic.twitter.com/OfPOf51PaU](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1492395365202808832/photo/1)

![3_1492386301135720454](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLYFbxLakAYINEX.png)

‚Üí There can be more than one media query on a webpage.

‚Üí Similar to this image, both media quires will be applied. [pic.twitter.com/KK6o4bs6Wj](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1492395371850760196/photo/1)

![3_1492386406286897154](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLYFh45aMAIYBbm.png)

‚Üí Suppose, the width of the screen is 400px, then which media queries will be applied?

‚Üí Both media queries will be applied in this case.

‚Üí Because the width of the screen is less than 600px and 1300px as well.

‚Üí Or, less than 600px both will be applied. [pic.twitter.com/XFh0BLM6O4](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1492395378528104451/photo/1)

![3_1492386556715606020](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLYFqpSaIAQbe58.jpg)

‚Üí And suppose, we have a screen that is greater than 600px that is 900px.

‚Üí Then which media queries will be applied for the 900px?

‚Üí So, in this case, only one media query will be applied which is less than 1300px.

üíöThat's all for now:) [pic.twitter.com/c5stqDSeFM](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1492395385222217734/photo/1)
