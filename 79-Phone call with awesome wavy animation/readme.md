Let me explain!üßµüëá [pic.twitter.com/qeal3BoYkb](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489078425407356928/video/1)

1Ô∏è‚É£ This is a simple code of HTML! [pic.twitter.com/qfuLr8snnK](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489078432701235200/photo/1)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Then, we have designed the container of the call icon. [pic.twitter.com/zLS6CULbcP](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489078438644563968/photo/1)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Now, wavy circles are designed by pseudo-elements.

- All properties are the same for both pseudo-elements but we have to change the "animation-delay" in one of them.

- Do not forget to set "0" as the value of the scale function. [pic.twitter.com/cDXVbyti2R](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489078444843749380/photo/1)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Now, we have to set the "animation delay" in any of them. [pic.twitter.com/qKuHQfVIbj](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489078450434768899/photo/1)

5Ô∏è‚É£ Finally, we have to set the keyframes.

- at 0% ‚Üí set "0" as the value of the scale function.

- at 100% ‚Üí set "2" as the value of the scale function.

- Do not forget to set "0" as the value of "opacity" at 100%! [pic.twitter.com/EnVW22YwQK](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489078456751357952/photo/1)
