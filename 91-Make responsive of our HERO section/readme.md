üìå First of all, we have to find the breakpoints of our website.

‚Üí So here, the heading of the HERO section is breaking, that's why at approx 1100px is the first breakpoint of our website. [pic.twitter.com/ydRUtCjbRm](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1493556409316700161/photo/1)

‚ÜíAs well as we are going to decrease the font size of the client faces of the HERO section.

‚õîBut we do not want to use PX values on our website.

‚ÜíI want to use dynamic units like rem or em.

‚õî Remember, we have set the 62.5% in the root element.

üìå Do you know??

‚ÜíThe font size = 62.5%, does not affect on the place of "media feature" in media queries.

‚õî Here, 1rem = 1em = 16px, but not 10px!!

‚ÜíThat's why we have to convert 1100px into rem units, but 1rem = 16px

‚õî Calculation

16px = 1rem
1100px = ?rem

?rem = 1rem * 1100px / 16px ==> 68.75rem (round value = 68.5rem)

üëÄ See the codeüëá [pic.twitter.com/xGKGpfUY0u](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1493556424508542977/photo/1)

‚ÜíAt this breakpoint, we have to change the following elements.

1. Heading

- Decrease the size of the font.

‚õî‚õî‚õî3.6rem = 36px (Here font-size = 62.5% iapplied) [pic.twitter.com/HhB8GvQesz](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1493556431403945985/photo/1)

2. The text content of the client's faces.

- As well as I have warped it in another container, check it out in HTML docs.

- Here, I have changed the size of the text as well as removed margin from the text content of the client's faces. [pic.twitter.com/hUYyxrOfEH](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1493556438144147456/photo/1)

![3_1493556433530490880](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLotqcCVkAAWpF-.jpg)

‚ÜíAlso, I have changed the direction of flex into a "column" of the client's faces.

üòç That's all for now:) [pic.twitter.com/uqJhvGRYFz](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1493556444947304450/photo/1)
