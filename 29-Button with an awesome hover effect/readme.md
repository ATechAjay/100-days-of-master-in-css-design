💚Day 2️⃣9️⃣ /  1️⃣ 0️⃣0️⃣ days of Master in CSS Design series!

👉 So, to design this effect we have to follow these steps.

1️⃣  Divide the full width of the button into 4 parts.

2️⃣ Initially, 1st and 3rd parts are positioned above the button.

3️⃣ And 2nd and 4th parts are positioned below the button.

4️⃣ When we hover over the button, all parts are moved,
or are set as the background of the button.

😍 This is the main logic behind this desing!

⁉ So the main question is that, how do we divide the width of the button into 4 parts?

well:)

👉We achieve this job with "before" and "after" pseudo-elements.

🤔But, now you will say that by this only 2 parts will be able to be made what about another 2 parts?

👇

😎So, you are right and don't worry!

👉For another 2 parts, we have to add an inline element like the "span" tag.

👉And from its before and after element, you will be able to make the remaining 2 parts.

You have to position all parts like this.
