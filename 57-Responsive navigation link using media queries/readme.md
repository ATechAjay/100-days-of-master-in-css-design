🔔 The best thread on media queries is coming soon.

💚So stay tuned with me!

📌if you didn't follow me till now, then consider following me{[@ATechAjay](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay) }.

👉 First of all, we have to simple design our nav bar, Like we used to do before. [pic.twitter.com/KfZ3BY5n8c](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1481545252578394114/photo/1)

👉 Now when the width of the screen will be less than 850px, 

👉 then simply we have to change the direction on the flex-box.

👉 or, the code written inside the media queries will be executed, when the width of the screen is between 1px to 850px. [pic.twitter.com/TNY4kAgFcX](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1481545259394174978/photo/1)

👉 Here, when the width of the screen between is 1px to 850px then,

1. We have to change the direction of the flex.

2. Then we have to set 100% to the width of the "li" element.

Also, you can set the background color of the list elements. [pic.twitter.com/EqKGY97ndI](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1481545267610779651/photo/1)
