💚 Before we start to learn what media queries are!

❓ I have a question for you!

🤔 What is the main job of a gatekeeper?? [pic.twitter.com/zs3vk2wbNl](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1481955429077127168/photo/1)

😍 Maybe:

→ It is used to check that there is no explosive element have that person or something similar to that.

→ If that person has not any explosive element, then he should be allowed to come to the party,

→ otherwise, the gatekeeper can stop that person.

OR

→ or, the gatekeeper will say to that person, "sir you cannot come to this party"

📌 Otherwise, you can mess with something at this party.

→ or break, bother

💚Now come to the topics!😍

→ Media query is used to check some  conditions on a particular breakpoint,

and according to condition, it applied a style to a particular element at that breakpoint.

→ If the condition is true at a particular breakpoint, then the style will be applied.

🤔Breakpoints??

→ When the style of an element is breaking at some point, then it can be called a breakpoint.

→ Suppose, this is the navigation bar of a website!

breakpoint??

→ or, it is similar to the "if" statement of a programming language.

→ If the condition of the if block is true then the code will be executed.

→ Media queries start with "@media" keywords.

→ These are the types of media queries.

- all: default or for all media.

Eg:

When the width of the viewport I less than 850px then,

1. we are going to hide the navigation links.

❓ You can see here I do not add any media type?

because, it's optional but there is a condition, which is discussed in future threads. [pic.twitter.com/25zLd31uWm](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1481955484051832833/photo/1)
