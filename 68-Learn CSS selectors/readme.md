💚 Day 6️⃣7️⃣ / 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ Master in CSS Design series!

💥 Today we are going to learn CSS selectors.

→ Selectors are one of the tricky concepts in CSS.

→ There are many ways to select an HTML element in CSS, using a CSS selector.

📌 The BEST thread!

[#webdev](https://twitter.com/hashtag/webdev) 

Let me explain!🧵👇 [pic.twitter.com/rTKyK5fn15](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1485523443194146818/photo/1)

⁉ Why should we learn CSS selectors in our design series?

🤔 I think,

- If you want to become a good CSS developer, you must have to know CSS selectors.

- CSS selectors are many types, so you can be stuck during writing CSS code.

👀 I have one question for you!

🤔 What is the difference between the Descendent selector and child selectors?

📌 Notation
Descendent selector = {space}
child selectors = {>}

🤔 What are CSS selectors or what is the use of the CSS selectors?

→ CSS selector is used to select an HTML element, which we design that HTML element.

👉 CSS selectors are several types, we can divide them into 5 categories for our convenience.

1️⃣ Combinator(Combination) Selector
2️⃣ Simple Selector
3️⃣ Pseudo element Selector(::)
4️⃣ Pseudo class Selector(:)
5️⃣ Attribute Selector

But in this thread, we are going to learn, 

1️⃣ Combinator(Combination) Selector and its type.

⛔ Other selectors are going to learn in the next thread.

Let's start...

1️⃣ Combinator(Combination) Selector

🤔So, what is a combinator selector?

→ They combine other selectors in order to select HTML elements.

→ Or, these selectors are made up of two or more selectors.

→ Or, Combine means a 𝗺𝗶𝘅 of 2 or more selectors.

hope you got my point

👉 Combinator selectors further can be divided into 4 parts.

𝟭. Descendant combinator selector("space")

𝟮. Child combinator selector(>)

𝟯. Adjacent sibling combinator selector(+)

𝟰. General sibling combinator selector(~)

𝟭. Descendant combinator selector("space")

→ It selects each and every HTML element of a defined or specified element.

→ Or, it selects all HTML elements, which is the descendant of a defined element.

→ Or, Descendant means "𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗱" or "𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗱" of the parent.

→ Here you can see, all p elements inside the div element have been selected. [pic.twitter.com/KXPhcFdvnY](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1485523475607736321/photo/1)

𝟮. Child combinator selector(>):

→ It is used to select the "direct child" element of the specified element.

→ Or, It selects only direct children, not indirect.

→ Or, not grand chid or great grande child.

see here!

→ Selects all p elements inside the div element.

→ Selects all p elements inside the section element. [pic.twitter.com/sVkHYDl8wX](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1485523488765263873/photo/1)

👉 Codepen link of Child combinator selector(>)

[codepen.io/atechajay/pen/…](https://codepen.io/atechajay/pen/bGYbwEv)

👉 Now, What is the difference between descendant and child selector?

📌 Descendant selector:

→ Selects all HTML element, either direct child, grandchild, great-grandchild.

→ Or, Select nested elements.

→ Or, selects direct and indirect elements of the specified element.

📌 Child selector(>)

→ It selects on a direct child element.

→ Suppose you are a father and have a son, Here, a son is your direct child of yours.

⛔ but, It does not select your daughter's son, because your daughter's son is not a direct child of yours.😍

Hope...my point

𝟯. Adjacent sibling combinator selector(+):

→ It selects the "next" element of the specified element.

→ Or, Selects "Very close" element of the defined selector, which is the first one.

→ Or, it selects only one element.

→ Or, it selects only the first element.

→ You can see here, it selects only the nearest / first element of the "div" element. [pic.twitter.com/PPtWeP7Ac3](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1485526884125659138/photo/1)
