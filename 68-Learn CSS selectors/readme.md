💚 Day 6️⃣8️⃣ / 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ Master in CSS Design series!

💥 Today we are going to design a nesting drop-down menu.

⛔Without using float & display to none.

❓What's the main logic behind it with the codepen link?

Let me explain!👇🧵 [pic.twitter.com/qOOm5h1zEd](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1485645498409431040/video/1)

⛔ Maybe you can be a problem with spacing in this design.

📌But I am trying to figure out that problem.

Let's start...

📌 For this design, we are going to use only two new properties.

1. "scale" function of the transform property.
2. transform-origin property.

💚 Special thanks to [@_gulam_anas_](https://twitter.com/_gulam_anas_)  for contributing to this design.

1️⃣ scale() =  scaleX() + scaleY()

👉 For this design, we are going to use scaleY() for verticle(perpendicular) animation.

👉 Scale(0) means completely hiding that element.

👉 Scale(1) means that element will be visible.

👉 Or, same in the scaleX() and scaleY() function.

→ Initially, we have set to "0" as the value of the scaleY() function.

→ When we hover over that dropdown list element, then we have to set "1" as the value of the scaleY() function. [pic.twitter.com/xwxaiYrtQm](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1485645515878711300/photo/1)

❓ From which side do you want to apply animation?

- So, your answer will be "top"

→That's why we have to set "top" as the value of the transform-origin property.

→ You can also use "top left" or "top right" as the value of the transform-origin property. [pic.twitter.com/plKLc5e4o4](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1485645810008473600/photo/1)
