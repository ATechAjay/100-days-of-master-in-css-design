💚 Today's we are going to implement these ingredients in our existing project.

1️⃣ Implement the header section of the website.

2️⃣ Sets the size of the HERO image as equal to the text content of the HERO section.

3️⃣ Decrease the spacing between the header and the HERO content.

1️⃣ Implement the header section of the website.

- We have to keep our code above the content of the HERO section.

- We have to use "header" and the "nav" elements for semantics. [pic.twitter.com/YQc0Mu5g4t](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1491976819020791809/photo/1)

2️⃣ Sets the size of the HERO image as equal to the text content of the HERO section.

- This was creating problems when we were reducing the space from the top.

- That's why I have to change the height of the HERO image.

- The height of the text content = 440px

📌 That's why I change the height of the HERO image is equal to 440x as well. [pic.twitter.com/Q9XPFopNYt](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1491976828483162115/photo/1)

3️⃣ Decrease the spacing between the header and the HERO content.

- Now, I have to decrease the spacing between the header and the HERO content using the padding property.

💚 That's all for now:) [pic.twitter.com/WqBylT35o2](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1491976835185672193/photo/1)
