💚 Day 8️⃣1️⃣ / 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ days of Master in CSS Design series!

Let me explain!🧵👇 [pic.twitter.com/q8QeXa5SNl](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489909586484416512/video/1)

❓ Many people asked me, hey Ajay how to build layouts of the desired blueprint?

💚 The answer to this question is, we have to do more and more practice.

- For this design, many ways to warp elements inside other elements.

- It's up to you or your requirement.

⛔ Wait and see this picture thoroughly. [pic.twitter.com/nKpCOluU19](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489909596861116416/photo/1)

1️⃣ So according to the above picture, this is the HTML code. [pic.twitter.com/aLzaZlFDpi](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489910543024816129/photo/1)

2️⃣ Now we have to design our container.

- For adding space inside the container we have to set the padding property.

- And for shadows around the container, we have to set box-shadow property.

⛔#000 but less alpha value. [pic.twitter.com/nndYrcYMlR](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489910550163505155/photo/1)

3️⃣ Now we have aligned "label" elements and "input" fields column-wise.

- So there are many ways to achieve this.

👇continue in next... [pic.twitter.com/I2EfzZAAjW](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489910556459147264/photo/1)

![3_1489909967956377600](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FK05ONNagAA0g3W.png)

- But I am using flex-box for this, using the "flex-direction" property we can achieve those elements column-wise.

- And set the "gap" property for space between label and input field.

4️⃣ Now we have to learn,

the ": focus" selector for awesome design when the input field receives focus using a mouse or keyboard.

→ Applied CSS style to an element when the input field gets focused.

→ Or, which elements that receive focus using mouse or keyboard.

→ Or, Applied CSS styles when input fields are currently focused using mouse and keyboard.

→ This selector is used with input fields.

💚 Now come to our topic😍

🤩 So, when our input field gets focused then we have applied 2 CSS properties in all input fields.

1. Set box-shadow property.
2. And the background of the input field. [pic.twitter.com/XunHMpmFvX](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489910569469878277/photo/1)

5️⃣ Finally, we have to design our button as required. [pic.twitter.com/dHmDingvHL](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1489910575304159233/photo/1)
