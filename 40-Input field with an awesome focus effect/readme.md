Let me explain!👇🧵 [pic.twitter.com/x3dwnJDibM](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1475080512670629888/video/1)

→ A single property has been used to design this effect that is ": focus" pseudo-elements.

→ It represents an element such as an input element.

→ It is "active" when the user clicks or selects with any keyboard key such as the "tab" key on an element.

→ So, when we click over an input element then, 
the "label" element will be moved 16px from the initial position to the top.

→ As well as "color" and the "size" of the label element also will be changed.
