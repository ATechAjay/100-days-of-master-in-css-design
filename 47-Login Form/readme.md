Let me explain!🧵👇 [pic.twitter.com/Kr2W6i44KE](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1477931365072965634/photo/1)

→ The alignment of input, button, or label elements is not important.

📌The important thing for this design is that how to build this layout?

👉So, let's break it into 6 steps.

1️⃣ First, of all we have to define the height and width of the object. [pic.twitter.com/XLiRCXUIMm](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1477931370840145921/photo/1)

2️⃣ Now, using "before" pseudo-elements of the container, 

we are going to design this blue object approx 25% height of the entire container.

→ And set the border radius of this box. [pic.twitter.com/bMndJVpCCJ](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1477931373520293888/photo/1)

3️⃣ For the red box, Again we are going to use the "after" pseudo-element.

→ And set the border radius of this box as well. [pic.twitter.com/KHobjvOgVj](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1477931378175975428/photo/1)

4️⃣ Now, we want to set the custom color of the white box.

→ For this, I am going to use a "span" element relative to its container. [pic.twitter.com/Np3WZ94xs4](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1477931393019629568/photo/1)

![3_1477931383624400898](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FIKqw1NVgAIP7-_.jpg)

5️⃣ Then, we have to set the same background color as the background color of the input box.

For example, 
here I am going to set the red color in both boxes as background.

→ The next thread is for the "yellow" box! [pic.twitter.com/ePsByPppr4](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1477931395989213185/photo/1)

6️⃣ Then we have to set the same background color of the container as the background color of the "before" elements.

💚Amazing 💥😍 [pic.twitter.com/BBGY1BkgN3](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1477931399164227584/photo/1)

→ Now simply we have to design our content as required.

→ In my case, I am going to design  a login form using another container called "child"
