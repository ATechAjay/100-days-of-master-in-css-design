Let me explain!🧵👇 [pic.twitter.com/BkVDnlrM2q](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1482323799744061445/video/1)

📌 First of all, we have to learn a CSS property that is "background-clip"!

→ Well, using this property we can design our text as you saw in the video.

Let's start...

🤔 What is "background-clip" property?

→ It is used to spread the background(images/color) in your container element.

→ Or, How long do you want to spread your background images/color in your container?
that is defined by this property.

📌 Values of this property!

→ border-box(default) =>> Background spread up to the border of the container. 

→ padding-box =>> Backgound spread up to padding of the container.

→ content-box =>> Background spread up to content only. 

→ text =>> Background set as foreground the text. 

etc...

→ Suppose, this is the container, you can see here the dotted border as well as 30px as the padding of the container.

→ If we want to clip this image up to content only, then we have to use this property. [pic.twitter.com/tfssZ4vPoT](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1482323820161933318/photo/1)

→ But, if we want to spread the image up to the padding of the container, then we have to use this property. [pic.twitter.com/YAWYpg2Ccc](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1482323827350982663/photo/1)

→ Or, if we want to spread the image up to the border of the container, then we have to use this property. 

Remember this is also a default value. [pic.twitter.com/hdVwg7xlV9](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1482323835387256833/photo/1)

→ Now, if we want to set the images as a foreground of a text, then we have to use this property.

⛔ Don't forget to set transparent the value of the color property. [pic.twitter.com/RdtOmfz08u](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1482323843230629894/photo/1)

→ And the animation is very simple, we have to change the position of the image. [pic.twitter.com/EjEFahivFf](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1482323852252573696/photo/1)
