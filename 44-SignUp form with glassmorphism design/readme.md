📌This design is created using two CSS properties.

1️⃣ Background color
2️⃣ Backdrop-filter with "blur" value.

👉NOTE:  The backdrop is also known as background.

→ So, first of all, we have to set the background color of the "signup" form with low intensity.

→ As well as we have to set the gaussian blur with some low values. [pic.twitter.com/JwUCXtkMnx](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1476479083588423680/photo/1)

→  After that, I am going to add the background color of "h3" elements that is "sign up".

→ Here, I increased the alpha value to 0.2!

→ And, the same value we have used in the "button" element as well. [pic.twitter.com/jpr3bL2z5G](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1476479091595374592/photo/1)

→ When we hover over the button the alpha value increased to 0.3!
